## Code Details

The following technologies will be used in the application:

  - [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
  - [Found](https://github.com/4Catalyzer/found) for routing,
  - GraphQL for backend access descriptions and Relay Modern for code generation,
  - Back end database - TBD but probably Mongo (if possible Firebase)

The code in this repo is generated by following the following tutorials:

## Why React
In July 25, 2017 this section was updated so in a year from now the notes
below might not be as applicable.
The post below state the positive points of using React.
The biggest negative point of using React is the Facebook no compete licensing
clauses.

### GraphQL &gt; Firebase + Custom Code

Initially I wanted to use VUE js due to it cleaner syntax and significantly
quicker learning and development time. But when you look at adding a back
end data store GraphQL looks like it will save a lot of time over using
JSON and Firebase during development and production. Also back end tools
like Relay Modern will also make the database versioning during development
and production easier. While you can probably use GraphQL, Relay modern and
similar back end tools with Vue there will be a little bit of a lag with
new release because all the Vue tools will need to be updated.  

### React Native

React Native allows React technology to run on Android, iOS and Windows via UWP.
VUE an other UI platforms do no yet have mature mobile technology/path.
The speed/reponse of React Native is comparable to native Android and iOS
applications.

### React Fiber and Flow

The new version of React called React Fiber supports __Flow__ which allows
type annotation which allows for more managable code bases due to type
checking. Naturally flow can be use with other non-react application
but there will be a lag in adoption and maybe it will never be adopted.
